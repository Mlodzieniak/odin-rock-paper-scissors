I did menage to make working game but I decided to make it with a bit different rules.
Games end when player or computer score 2 points.
At this point code is a bit messy. First I wanted to make use of arrow functions but quickly realised they dont work as I wanted. Propably gonna make it a bit better in near future when I educate myself a bit more. Whole project took me about 2.5 hour.
